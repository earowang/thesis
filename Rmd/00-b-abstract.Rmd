# Abstract {-}

This work exposes a need for conceptually framing the handling of temporal data in a data-centric workflow. 

This thesis makes three original contributions for the temporal data analysis. All three are grounded in an exploratory data analysis for time-indexed data. The first contribution (Chapter \@ref(ch:calendar-vis)) is a new technique for visualising data using a calendar layout. It is most useful when the data relates to human activity, and embeds plots in the familiar calendar. The second contribution (Chapter \@ref(ch:tsibble)) is a new data abstraction which streamlines transformation, visualisation, and modelling in temporal contexts. This "tsibble" object is a data infrastructure holding the foundation of temporal data pipelines. The third contribution (Chapter \@ref(ch:mists)) is to equip analysts with exploratory and explanatory tools for discovering missing patterns in time.
