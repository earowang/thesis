# Introduction {#ch:intro}

This thesis makes three original contributions for the analysis of temporal data. All three are grounded in an exploratory data analysis pipeline for time-indexed data. The research begins  with a new technique for visualising data using a calendar layout, that fits neatly into a pipeline workflow. It is most useful when the data relates to human activity, and provides plots in the familiar calendar. The second contribution is a new data abstraction which streamlines transformation, visualisation, and modelling for time series analysis. This "tsibble" data object is infrastructure holding the foundation of time series pipelines. The tsibble representation exposed a need for conceptually framing handling of temporal missing values in the data-centric workflow, and this is the third contribution of the thesis: exploratory and explanatory tools for understanding missing patterns in time.  

Time series analysis has assumed that the entry point for analysts is at model-ready data format, that provides little organisation or conceptual oversight on one should get the wild data into a tamed state. This mind-set is related to a long-held belief that exploratory data analysis is a highly ad hoc statistical area, impossible to teach or formalise. However, the tidyverse framework as originating in @wickham2014tidy, fundamentally overturns this thinking. "Tidy data" as a fundamental unit beneath data plots and data wrangling can be formally described using a generalised set of abstract grammar. For example, the grammar of graphics and data manipulation, as implemented in the **ggplot2** [@R-ggplot2] and **dplyr** [@R-dplyr] R packages, respectively, form the core of the **tidyverse** concepts and suite of tools. My contributions extend the **tidyverse** way of thinking to the temporal domain, by providing tidy tools for supporting fluent workflow in temporal data series.

## Calendar-based graphics {#sec:calendar-vis}

Visualisation is critical in understanding the prominent data patterns as well as revealing the unexpected for exploratory data analysis. Calendar heatmaps are one of the widely used techniques for plotting people's activities on a daily basis. The comprehensive literature review on calendar-based graphics is given in Chapter \@ref(ch:calendar-vis). However, calendar plots are limited in ways that graphical encoding is colour only and data input is a single value for each day. I develop a new method to ensemble small multiples into a calendar layout. It can be fully integrated into the grammar of graphics [@wilkinson2006grammar; @wickham2009ggplot2], which defines plots as a functional mapping from data variables to graphical primitives. This new calendar-based display facilitates to unfold more vivid and detailed data stories regarding daily and sub-daily human behaviours.

## Tidy temporal data structure {#sec:tsibble}

Data representation has been more often discussed in data science. "Tidy data" [@wickham2014tidy] is the fundamental data architecture of the **tidyverse** ecosystem, making it possible to build fluent data pipelines for transformation, visualisation, and modelling. But the current time series structure that was useful decades ago for modelling now starts creating barriers for a data-centric workflow. More discussions on data structures can be found in Chapter \@ref(ch:tsibble). I propose a new tidy data abstraction for temporal data, which lubricates the plumbing of temporal data analysis to a great extent.

## Missingness in time {#sec:mists}

## Summary

Chapter \@ref(ch:calendar-vis) provides full details of the calendar plot, algorithm and application. Chapter \@ref(ch:tsibble) explains the new data abstraction, tsibble, and illustrates how it can be used to for the basis of exploratory methods, visualisation and modelling of temporal data. Chapter \@ref{ch:mists} outlines a new nomenclature for temporal missing patterns, tools to identify these processes in data, and evaluate imputation results. 
Chapter \@ref(ch:conclusion) summarises the software tools developed for the work and the impact, and discusses the future plans.
